## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-23

Hardening release addressing the external review: concurrency-safe replay
protection, byte-for-byte reproducible vectors, keyed identity hashing, and
embedder-robustness guarantees.

### Changed — BREAKING

- **`pioneer_uid_hash` is now a versioned HMAC tag** (`h1:<43 base64url
  chars>` = HMAC-SHA256 over the NFC-normalized UID with a backend secret of
  ≥16 chars). Bare sha256 hex no longer passes schema validation. Registries
  may still *read* legacy `[0-9a-f]{64}` tags via `markEligible`.
  Migration: backends must provision `uidSecret` and re-hash.
- **Nonce stores must implement atomic `claimIfAbsent(key)`**; the previous
  non-atomic `has()`+`add()` pair is no longer used by the pipeline. Custom
  stores must migrate to the new interface (a DB unique constraint or Redis
  SETNX satisfies it).
- Canonical JSON now normalizes all strings to NFC before serialization and
  enforces a depth cap of 64. Events containing non-NFC string forms or
  nesting beyond the cap are rejected.

### Added

- Atomic replay protection: `InMemoryNonceStore.claimIfAbsent` (indivisible
  test-and-set) and `FileNonceStore.claimIfAbsent` (cross-process O_EXCL
  lockfile with stale-lock takeover → fresh re-read under lock → fsynced
  append). A claim that returned true survives hard restarts; torn trailing
  log lines and malformed entries fail closed and are counted
  (`corruptLines`); `compact()` rewrites via temp-file + atomic rename.
- Deterministic key material: `generateKeyPair({ seed })` derives Ed25519
  keys from a 32-byte seed via PKCS#8 DER; committed vectors now use fixed
  seeds and fixed nonces and are **byte-for-byte reproducible** across runs,
  enforced in CI with `git diff --exit-code -- vectors/`.
- Attack vector `20_prototype_key_app`: app id set to an inherited object-
  prototype property name — rejected with `UNKNOWN_APP` (suite now 20/20).
- New test suite `test/hardening.test.js` (13 tests): seeded-key RFC 8032
  equivalence, world reproducibility, double-claim exclusion, two-instance
  durable-store contention, crash reload, corrupt-log tolerance, prototype
  probes, depth-cap enforcement, NFC stability, malformed PEM degradation to
  `INVALID_SIGNATURE`, clock-rollback replay rejection.
- Python cross-verifier parity for NFC normalization and the canonicalization
  depth cap.

### Security

- Registry lookups and writes use own-property semantics throughout;
  `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` writes are refused.
- UID hashing upgraded from unkeyed sha256 to keyed HMAC-SHA256 with version
  prefix — precomputation/rainbow-table attacks over the Pi UID space are no
  longer feasible; `h2:` rotation path documented in SECURITY.md.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Deterministic PEP/1 verification pipeline: fixed 9-step order — `SCHEMA`,
  `APP_KNOWN`, `KEY_ACTIVE`, `CANONICALIZATION`, `SIGNATURE`,
  `TIMESTAMP_FRESHNESS`, `WEIGHT_BOUND`, `ELIGIBILITY`, `NONCE_REPLAY`.
- Closed-profile JSON canonicalization (JCS subset, integers only,
  byte-stable output).
- Ed25519 signing via Node.js stdlib `node:crypto` (RFC 8032).
- App/key registry with key rotation and instant revocation
  (`REVOKED_KEY` path).
- KYC/Mainnet eligibility gating backed by a launchpad-side registry
  cross-check (`INELIGIBLE_USER`), never trusted from signed payloads alone.
- Bounded engagement-weight classes enforced even over valid signatures
  (`WEIGHT_OVERFLOW`).
- Per-application replay protection; nonces are burned only on full pass
  (`REPLAY_DETECTED`). Failed verification never burns the nonce.
- CLI: `keygen`, `init-reg`, `add-key`, `revoke-key`, `eligible`, `sign`,
  `verify`, `attacks`, `demo`.
- Adversarial suite: 19 attacks, each rejected with its exact error code
  (`19/19 rejected`).
- Independent pure-Python cross-verifier (`scripts/cross-verify.py`,
  RFC 8032, standard library only) re-verifying every committed vector.
- Reproducible conformance vectors (`vectors/`) regenerated and re-checked
  on every CI run.
- CI matrix: Node 18/20/22 × Ubuntu/Windows plus Python 3.10/3.12
  cross-verification on both operating systems.
- Documentation: `SPEC.md` (normative wire format), `SECURITY.md`
  (threat model and explicit limitations), `TRACEABILITY.md`
  (PR #2 requirement ↔ code ↔ test ↔ attack mapping).
- Dual licensing under `(MIT OR Apache-2.0)`.
